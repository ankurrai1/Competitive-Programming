As Salamo Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barkatahu,
I am thankful to Allah for giving me the opportunity to compile many of my favorite
Moral Stories, in the form of an electronic book, which I had collected from various
resources, since last few years. Even though many of these stories are fictional in
nature, but at the end they will give a great lesson to learn for a lifetime.
As the reader can himself see from these stories, the subject “Moral” is universal to
every human being. Hence these stories are not just for any particular sect or the
followers of particular faith, it is for the entire humanity, irrespective of there belief,
culture, race, color or age. So, let’s start with a Moral Story called as “A POND FULL
OF MILK.”
Once there was a king who told some of his workers to dig a pond. Once the pond was
dug, the king made an announcement to his people saying that one person from each
household has to bring a glass of milk during the night and pour it into the pond. So,
the pond should be full of milk by the morning. After receiving the order, everyone
went home.
One man prepared to take the milk during the night. He thought that since everyone
will bring milk, he could just hide a glass of water and pour inside the pond. Because it
will be dark at night, no one will notice. So he quickly went and poured the water in the
pond and came back. In the morning, the king came to visit the pond and to his
surprise the pond was only filled with water! What has happened is that everyone was
thinking like the other man that “I don't have to put the milk, someone else will do it.”
