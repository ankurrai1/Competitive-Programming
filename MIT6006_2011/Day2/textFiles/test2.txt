One man prepared to take the milk during the night. He thought that since everyone
will bring milk, he could just hide a glass of water and pour inside the pond. Because it
will be dark at night, no one will notice. So he quickly went and poured the water in the
pond and came back. In the morning, the king came to visit the pond and to his
surprise the pond was only filled with water! What has happened is that everyone was
thinking like the other man that “I don't have to put the milk, someone else will do it.”
Dear friends, when it comes to help the Religion of Allah, do not think that others will
take care of it. Rather, it starts from you, if you don’t do it, no one else will do it. So,
change yourself to the way of Allah to serve Him and that will make the difference.
With this I will end my little introduction and pray that
May Almighty Allah accept it. So that we may all benefit
from these stories.
Wassalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmutallahi Wa Barkatahu
