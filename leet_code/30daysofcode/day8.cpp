// problem statement is as following

// You are given an array coordinates, coordinates[i] = [x, y], where [x, y] represents the coordinate of a point.
// Check if these points make a straight line in the XY plane.


// the basic concept is slop will be same at each point and its previous points
// slop = y2-y1 / x2-x1
